# RNN - Recurrent Neural Network - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent
# RNN are used for time series data 
# RNN main use are for text data example  text generation, text classification, text translation, text summarization

# transformers are used for text data
# Difference between RNN and transformers is that RNN are sequential and transformers are parallel

# CNN are used for images
# GAN are used for images
# Autoencoders are used for images
# VAE are used for images
# DQN are used for images
