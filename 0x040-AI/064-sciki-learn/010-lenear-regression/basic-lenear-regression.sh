# lenear regression  is based on the assumption that the data is linearly separable 
# and the data is not noisy. 
# lenear regression is a supervised learning algorithm.
# lenear regression is used to predict the value of a continuous variable.
 # degree of polynomial is 1 
 # example of lenear regression is predicting the price of a house based on the size of the house.
