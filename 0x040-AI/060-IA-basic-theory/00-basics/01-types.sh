# the saic types of AI are:
# 1. supervised learning (SL) : 
#   the AI is trained with a set of data and a set of expected results (labels) for each data point.
#    The AI is then tested with new data and the expected results are compared to the results obtained by the AI.
#    The AI is then trained again with the new data and the expected results. 
#    This process is repeated until the AI is able to predict the expected results with a high accuracy.
# This type of AI is used in many applications such as: 
#   - image recognition (e.g. Google Photos)
#   - speech recognition (e.g. Google Assistant)
#   - text recognition (e.g. Google Translate)
#   - handwriting recognition (e.g. Google Keep)
these solves the problem of "classification" (i.e. the AI is able to classify data into categories) 
These can also be used to solve the problem of "regression" (i.e. the AI is able to predict a value for a given data point)


# 2. unsupervised learning (UL):
#   the AI is trained with a set of data but no expected results (labels) for each data point.
#    The AI is then tested with new data and the expected results are compared to the results obtained by the AI.
#    The AI is then trained again with the new data and the expected results.
#    This process is repeated until the AI is able to predict the expected results with a high accuracy.
# This type of AI is used in many applications such as:
#   - image recognition (e.g. Google Photos)
#   - speech recognition (e.g. Google Assistant)
#   - text recognition (e.g. Google Translate)
#   - handwriting recognition (e.g. Google Keep)
these solves the problem of "clustering" (i.e. the AI is able to group data into clusters)

# 3. reinforcement learning (RL)
#   the AI is trained with a set of data and a set of expected results (labels) for each data point.
#    The AI is then tested with new data and the expected results are compared to the results obtained by the AI.
#    The AI is then trained again with the new data and the expected results.
#    This process is repeated until the AI is able to predict the expected results with a high accuracy.
# This type of AI is used in many applications such as:
#   - image recognition (e.g. Google Photos)
#   - speech recognition (e.g. Google Assistant)
#   - text recognition (e.g. Google Translate)
#   - handwriting recognition (e.g. Google Keep)
these solves the problem of "prediction" (i.e. the AI is able to predict the next step in a sequence)
